# Chapter 5 - Prompt Engineering

- Prompt engineering refers to the process of crafting an instruction that gets a model to generate the desired outcome
- Prompt engineering is the easiest and most common model adaptation technique. Unlike finetuning, prompt engineering guides a model’s behavior without changing the model’s weights. Thanks to the strong base capabilities of foundation models, many people have successfully adapted them for applications using prompt engineering alone. You should make the most out of prompting before moving to more resource-intensive techniques like finetuning.
- Prompt engineering’s ease of use can mislead people into thinking that there’s not much to it.1 At first glance, prompt engineering looks like it’s just fiddling with words until something works. While prompt engineering indeed involves a lot of fiddling, it also involves many interesting challenges and ingenious solutions
- Anyone can communicate, but not everyone can communicate effectively. Similarly, it’s easy to write prompts but not easy to construct effective prompts.
- Some people argue that “prompt engineering” lacks the rigor to qualify as an engineering discipline. However, this doesn’t have to be the case. Prompt experiments should be conducted with the same rigor as any ML experiment, with systematic experimentation and evaluation.
- “The problem is not with prompt engineering. It’s a real and useful skill to have. The problem is when prompt engineering is the only thing people know.” To build production-ready AI applications, you need more than just prompt engineering. You need statistics, engineering, and classic ML knowledge to do experiment tracking, evaluation, and dataset curation.
- This chapter covers both how to write effective prompts and how to defend your applications against prompt attacks.
