# Book: Grokking Concurrency by Kirill Bobrov

(https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-concurrency/9781633439771)

- A concurrent system is a system that can deal with many things at once.
- Concurrency is decoupling strategy!

- The opposite of sequential programming is concurrent programming. 
- Concurrency is based on the idea that there are independent computations that can be executed in an arbitrary order with the same outcome.
- The requirement of Parallel execution: task independence and hardware support.
-  Just because you can write programs to be parallel doesn’t mean you always should, because the costs and overhead associated with parallelization sometimes outweigh the benefits.
  - LET'S GET ONE INTERESTING EXAMPLE FOR THIS ONE ABOVE.
- Concurrency is about multiple tasks that start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods in no specific order. Parallelism is about multiple tasks running at the same time on hardware with multiple computing resources
- parallelism does not imply concurrency (????)
- Rob Pike: “Concurrency is about DEALING with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about DOING lots of things at once.”
