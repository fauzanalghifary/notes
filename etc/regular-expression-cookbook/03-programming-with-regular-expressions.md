# Chapter 3: Programming with Regular Expressions

### 3.0 Intro

- This chapter explains how to implement regular expressions with your programming language of choice.
- Because of the level of detail in this chapter, reading it from start to finish may get a bit tedious. If you’re reading Regular Expression Cookbook for the first time, we recommend you skim this chapter to get an idea of what can or needs to be done. Later, when you want to implement one of the regular expressions from the following chapters, come back here to learn exactly how to integrate the regexes with your programming language of choice.
- Chapters 4 through 9 use regular expressions to solve real-world problems. Those chapters focus on the regular expressions themselves, and many recipes in those chapters don’t show any source code at all. To make the regular expressions you find in those chapters work, simply plug them into one of the code snippets in this chapter.
- Because the other chapters focus on regular expressions, they present their solutions for specific regular expression flavors, rather than for specific programming languages. Regex flavors do not correspond one-on-one with programming languages. Scripting languages tend to have their own regular expression flavor built-in, and other programming languages rely on libraries for regex support. Some libraries are available for multiple languages, while certain languages have multiple libraries available for them.
