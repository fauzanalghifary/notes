# Chapter 1: Introduction to Regular Expressions

### Regular Expressions Defined 

- to verify whether input fits into the text pattern, to find text that matches the pattern within a larger body of text, to replace text matching the pattern with other text or rearranged bits of the matched text, to split a block of text into a list of subtexts, and to shoot yourself in the foot
- If your job involves manipulating or extracting text on a computer, a firm grasp of regular expressions will save you plenty of overtime.
- Aside from bug fixes that affect corner cases, regex flavors tend not to change, except to add features by giving new meaning to syntax that was previously treated as an error:

### Search and Replace with Regular Expressions

- Search-and-replace is a common job for regular expressions. A search-and-replace function takes a subject string, a regular expression, and a replacement string as input. The output is the subject string with all matches of the regular expression replaced with the replacement text.
